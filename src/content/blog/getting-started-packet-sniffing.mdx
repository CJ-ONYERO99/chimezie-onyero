> This is a beginner‑friendly overview — always capture traffic responsibly and with permission.

## Why sniff packets?

Understanding what flows across a network helps you learn protocols, spot anomalies, and debug issues. Tools like Wireshark make this accessible with filters and visualizations.

## Setup

- Install Wireshark
- Choose an interface (e.g., Wi‑Fi)
- Start a short capture while loading a simple website

## Basic filters

Try these display filters:

```
dns
http
tcp.port == 443
```

## Next steps

Annotate interesting packets, save captures, and write a short summary of what you observed. Practice ethical guidelines and keep learning.
